# DotNet.Status.Web

## Overview

The `DotNet.Status.Web` service is a web application used by the .NET Engineering Services team to monitor and manage the status of engineering workflows. It provides APIs and webhooks for tracking deployments, build notifications, and other engineering processes. The service integrates with tools like Azure DevOps, GitHub, and Grafana to provide real-time status updates and annotations.

Key features include:
- Deployment tracking with start and end annotations in Grafana.
- Integration with Azure DevOps for build and timeline notifications.
- GitHub webhook support for milestone management and issue tracking.

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the `DotNet.Status.Web` service, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have access to the required Azure subscription and resource group.
   - Install the necessary tools, including the Azure CLI and .NET SDK.

2. **Build the Application**:
   - Run the following commands to build the application:
     ```bash
     dotnet restore
     dotnet build
     ```

3. **Configure Deployment Settings**:
   - Update the deployment configuration in the `eng/deploy.yaml` file. Ensure the following parameters are set correctly:
     - `ServiceConnectionName`: The Azure service connection name.
     - `DotNetStatusAppName`: The name of the Azure App Service.
     - `DeploymentEnvironment`: The target environment (e.g., staging or production).

4. **Deploy to Azure**:
   - Use the Azure DevOps pipeline or run the following command to deploy manually:
     ```bash
     az webapp deployment source config-zip \
       --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> \
       --name <DotNetStatusAppName> \
       --src <PathToZipFile>
     ```
   - Alternatively, use the `AzureRmWebAppDeployment@4` task in the pipeline to automate deployment.

5. **Post-Deployment Validation**:
   - Verify that the service is running by navigating to the deployed URL.
   - Check the logs in Azure App Service for any errors.
   - Ensure Grafana annotations and Azure DevOps integrations are functioning as expected.

6. **Environment-Specific Configuration**:
   - Update the `appsettings.json` or environment variables for the deployed environment. Key settings include:
     - [AzureDevOpsOptions](http://_vscodecontentref_/2): Base URL, organization, and project details.
     - [GrafanaOptions](http://_vscodecontentref_/3): API token and base URL for Grafana integration.
     - `GitHubAuthentication`: GitHub OAuth settings.
